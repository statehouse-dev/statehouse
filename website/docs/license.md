3. **Sustainable development**: Enables future commercial editions to fund development

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use Statehouse in my commercial product?

### Can I modify Statehouse for my needs?

Yes, for your own use. You cannot distribute modified versions.

### Can I offer a service that uses Statehouse?

Yes, if Statehouse is a component of your service. You cannot offer Statehouse itself as a managed service.

### Is this like SSPL or BSL?
